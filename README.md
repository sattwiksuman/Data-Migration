# Data-Migration
Data Migration was carried out from an old database to a new database. The data comprised of responses of questionnaires collected from more than 9500 companies over 13 years. The work involved mapping the database tables, cleaning the data, handling redundancies, generating INSERT statements taking care of the constraints and testing the data for accuracy.

This repository only contains the SQL statements that were intially tried out while learning Postgres SQL. Various SQL statements pertaining to creation of database and tables, copying, merging and joining tables, importing sql files into existing databases and exporting sql files into .csv files etc are all included in the sample SQL file attached.
